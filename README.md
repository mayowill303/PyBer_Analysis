# PyBer_Analysis
In this module, you'll learn how to graph data using the Matplotlib library. Matplotlib has a rich set of features for creating and annotating charts that visualize data in a Data Series or DataFrame. You'll use Matplotlib to create line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, bubble charts, pie charts, and box-and-whisker plots, and make them visually compelling and informative by adding titles, axes labels, legends, and custom colors. You'll also be introduced to SciPy, a statistical Python package, and NumPy, a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. You'll use Pandas, SciPy, and NumPy to perform summary statistics.
